# NowNow Time Browser

This is an example interface for browsing through different timelines and timescales.

In theory you can use this to schedule meetings across time zones, to compare different calendars (e.g. Hebrew and Gregorian), or to browse a database of every event in the history of the universe.

It's not a github page right now because it needs to render images server-side. I should fix that eventually.
